## Project Description
I plan to make a JAMStack Website using contentful and gatsby. I wanted to make a portfolio website for professional gamers. The website will showcase videos of their gameplay, any merchandise that they sell, as well as any relevant tournament experience information. It will be meant for gamers to showcase their talent to professional esports teams as well as a platform for them to sell or advertise merchandise/sponsorships.
